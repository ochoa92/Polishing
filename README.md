# Polishing
This package has useful algorithms for polishing tasks.

# The packages "polishing_results_IECON", "update_polishing_results" and "polishing_results_IEEEJOURNAL"
These packages are for plot robot results

# The package "polishing_with_3D_CAD"
This package is the most important. Permits the user to open a 3D CAD of a mold saved in a ".stl" format. 
Then select a polishing area (use the file "polishing_area.m") with the computer mouse and after that,
all the normals inside this area are extracted and plotted. For more info see the "polishing_area.m" file.

That's all!!!
